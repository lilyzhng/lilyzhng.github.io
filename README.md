# Lily Zhang

I am a Technical Lead and Research Scientist, based in Bay Area, California.

I currently work at [Latitude AI](https://lat.ai/) on synthetic data and vision language models.

From 2019 to 2024, I was at Ford Greenfield Labs, focusing on AI algorithms for [building offboard models as data engine](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-lab-road-turning-self-driving-research-production-zhang/?trackingId=eV%2FKTo9HTx6STl2nFehbLA%3D%3D). Before that, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at BMW working on perception.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Focus

My research has involved:
- [Dynamic scene generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15447)
- [Data diversification](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Zhang_SIMBAR_Single_Image-Based_Scene_Relighting_for_Effective_Data_Augmentation_for_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf)
- [Data clustering](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022W/VDU/papers/Jaipuria_deepPIC_Deep_Perceptual_Image_Clustering_for_Identifying_Bias_in_Vision_CVPRW_2022_paper.pdf)
- [Data equity](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023W/OODCV/papers/Shrivastava_DatasetEquity_Are_All_Samples_Created_Equal_In_The_Quest_For_ICCVW_2023_paper.pdf)
- [Deflating data bias](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2020/papers/w45/Jaipuria_Deflating_Dataset_Bias_Using_Synthetic_Data_Augmentation_CVPRW_2020_paper.pdf)

As a side open-source project, I built [Deep-Seek](https://github.com/dzhng/deep-seek), an LLM-powered retrieval engine that became GitHub's #1 rated data retrieval repository.
